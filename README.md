Implementation examples, unit tests, and simulations for
[quadra](https://github.com/float32/quadra).

---

## Implementation examples

There's currently a single implementation example, written for the
[STM32F4 Discovery](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html)
board. See `example/README.md`.


## Unit tests

A suite of unit tests for the decoder and encoder can be found in the
`unit_tests` directory. They depend on:

- [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/)
- [libsamplerate](http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/index.html)

Run the tests using these commands:

    make check
    make py-check


## Simulation

There are simulations of the decoder, demodulator, and PLL under the `sim`
directory. Run them with the commands:

    make run-sim-decoder
    make run-sim-demodulator
    make run-sim-pll

You can view simulation traces using [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/),
for which project files are provided.
